DCCALLOW [list|+nickname|-nickname]

DCCALLOW command controls your private list of users
who are allowed to send dcc commands to you.
+/- nickname as parameter will cause the addition
or the removal of the given nickname from this list.
The list parameter will display your actual list
of dcc allowed users.

You may allow DCCs of filetypes which are otherwise blocked by the IRC server
by specifying a DCC allow for the user you want to recieve files from.
For instance, to allow the user bob to send you file.exe, you would type:
/dccallow +bob
and bob would then be able to send you files. bob will have to resend the file
if the server gave him an error message before you added him to your allow list.
/dccallow -bob
Will do the exact opposite, removing him from your dcc allow list.
/dccallow list
Will list the users currently on your dcc allow list.
