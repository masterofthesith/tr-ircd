OPERDO <help|mode|kick|topic|join> <channel> [parameters]

This operator only command can be used to override
some of the settings in the channel, without having
required channel privileges.

Examples:

/operdo MODE #test +m

Will set the channel #test +m.

/operdo KICK #test Lamer :out!

Will kick the user Lamer from the channel #test.

/operdo JOIN #test +o TheOne

Will make you join #test and set +o to TheOne.
If TheOne is your nick, then you get channelop status.
This may be useful, if a channel is taken over, and
you want to see what is happening in it.
Then you can /operdo join #test +oa yournick yournick
