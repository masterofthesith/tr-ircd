21.05.2002
.  Removed strncat and strncpy and strncpyzt. Implemented strlcat 
   and strlcpy for this task.
.  Redesigned some information used for versioning.
20.05.2002
.  Added md5sums also for the include/ directory, updated m_hash
   for this.
.  Added Bahamut style control for acebots. GCOS check function
   discovered by PB@dal.net
.  Redesigned listen { }, added subblocks to define a listen set.
   This allows to use { ip, port }; as well as { port, ip }; 
   And so is this appropriate with the rest of the block
   theory, and the listen subblock elements do no longer
   require a predefined queue like: first the ip, then its ports.
   Now you can freely write things the way you like it.
   In plan is also a way of specifying multiple ip addresses
   in the same listen subblock. Also updated manpage and the
   example configuration file for this.

18.05.2002

   This required modification of client and channel structures
   and renaming tsinfo and channelts fields to tsval.
17.05.2002

   buffers solved. 
.  Removed old GMP support, was unnecessary.
02.05.2002
.  Bugs in AKILL-RAKILL-EXCLUDE-REXCLUDE with regards to
   Uline issues solved.
01.05.2002
.  Bug in MODE command a la MODE #channel +. nick solved.
29.04.2002

28.04.2002
.  Cosmetic fixes to procotol reply functions.
.  Bug in /stats O solved.
.  Bug in SVSJOIN solved.
.  Tests show that Ipv6 support can be compiled with cygwin 
   and using Microsofts IPV6 API.

.pre5
25.04.2002
.  Changes to /list so that it now works.
.  Unused code about motd cleaned up, motd section is now in
   server/s_motd.c
22.04.2002
.  Cleaned up bugs in the parser.
.  Added u_int32_t fix for cygwin.
.  Bug in linker with static modules solved.
21.04.2002
.  Implemented protocol changes to the CLIENT line to
   inform the remote server about the ipv6 ip address
   of the client.
.  Made /userip command be able to display IPv6 hosts.
.  Implemented hostmask match algorithms from hybrid7 to
   make match_ipmask() better. This now also works for
   ipv6 addresses.
.  Ipv6 Protocol support is now fully functional.
20.04.2002
.  Implemented some IPv6 technologies to make the ircd listen
   and accept on IPv6 addresses. The code for this is currently
   not finished.
19.04.2002
.  Added a new way of Timestamp checking modes: TMODE, token ~
   This will prevent modes from being inconsistent on two 
   sides of the network after a netjoin.
.  Added the determiner %T for ircvsnprintf, stating a
   channelts or tsinfo value for the given structure.

.pre4
19.04.2002
.  Missing checks in cm_flood.c and cm_limit.c are filled.
   These would have prevented the ircd from correctly setting
   modes when parameters of +l or +f were incorrect.
18.04.2002
.  The SJOIN case seems to be solved. The problems about
   inconsistent letters in the MODE lines have now vanished.
   They happened due to a misplaced check of buffers.
17.04.2002
.  Added a contributional module for GETLANG command, to get
   the ID of the given language.
.  Created a way to inform other servers about the chosen
   language of a user. This is done with the MODE command,
   it uses the +L <number> as a parameter and informs
   other servers about language changes (/setlang)
   Initial language is already propagated with the CLIENT
   line, and the NICK line are used by software which is
   unable to use Identities, tokens and languages.
.  Modified the SVSMODE command, to support the +L mode
   for a user to change their language.
   It is also possible to use multiple mode flags with
   SVSMODE line (+rdL <servicesid> <langnum>)
.  Added the +L flag to the /who command to search for
   users with the given language
.  Also made general fixes to the m_who.c
08.04.2002
.  get_channel() has been updated and is now create_channel.
   To find existing channels, find_channel shall be used.
.  After a test compilation with -Wmissing-declarations
   those cases are now solved.
05.04.2002
.  In order to prevent collisions, %-C has been renamed
   to %~C.
03.04.2002
.  Problems with mode letters in CHFL_ case solved.
.  Removed list.c and moved its contents to client.c and
   channel.c
.  Bug with +l or +k in SJOIN solved.
02.04.2002
.  Small debug fixes for parse.c
.  Conflict case in the bison/flex parser solved. timespec
   values shall no longer be added.
01.04.2002
.  Merged %D %E %F %I into %C -> %-C %^C %*C %!C
.  Rewrote ircsprintf.c. Is now shorter and faster.
.  Found a new way of parsing hooks faster. hook_call_event
   no longer uses strings, but hook ids to call the hooks.
31.03.2002
.  Fixed tons of typos in ircd.conf.5 and example.conf
30.03.2002
.  Fixed evil buffer owerflow case in line buffering.

.  Bug in find_conf*, where the absolute status instead of inclusion
   was used, solved. 
.  Turkish language module mostly finalized.
.  Fixes in the parser for newer versions of bison (taken from h7)
24.03.2002
.  Created a makecontrib script, which makes the user choose which
   modules to include from contrib/ if the ircd is compiled with
   STATIC_MODULES defined.
23.03.2002
.  Added new options to configure to make the ircd be able to compile
   with static modules and support trircd4 and Bahamut.
.  Added example protocol and example language modules under contrib/
.  Made channel svsmode work again. Return value problems with hooks
   in remove_matching_nuhs solved.
22.03.2002
.  Privilege problems in MODE-TOPIC-KICK solved. Was due to a failure
   in the handling of dlink lists.
21.03.2002

.  Made NICK and SERVER introduction code hook based, 
   Protocol modules add the correct hooks.
17.03.2002 
.  Created a way to support more than two protocols.
   Protocol support is now done on a modular basis, and it is
   possible to support Bahamut pelennor and halcyon ircds.
   Due to the high amount of necessary changes, it is not
   planned to support other ircds.
16.03.2002 
.  Finally Fixed the problem leading into core after /rehash
   It was due to removal of the CONF_CLIENT multiple times.
15.03.2002 
.  Changed m_services.c so that it also uses tokens.
13.03.2002
